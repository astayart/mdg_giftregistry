this is a repository of the code for my progress with
the book Magento PHP Developers Guide by Allan MacGregor.
Other resources can be found on the authors github:

https://github.com/amacgregor/mdg_giftreg

This repo reflects code being created to work with Magento
Enterprise version 1.13.1.0

Some differences from Mr. MacGregor's code are meant to avoid
collision with the Enterprise GiftRegistry module, in particular
the frontend route. Othere relate to issues found with the module.
for instance, in ...template/mdg/edit.phtml, the author relies on 
the current loaded registry being in the session, however, if the
registry has not yet been viewed by the current user, it will not
be available.

OK, so at this point i have reached the end of chapter 4 where
we are kicked over to 
http://magedevguide.com/chapter4/adding-products-registry. In this 
section, MacGregor directs us to edit a base/default template, 
which i was under the impression was a bad idea. So I am going to 
deviate from this path to create a custom 'package' and 'theme' 
and use a symlink to the Enterprise default theme to maintain
Enterprise default behavior where needed. I may also decide to 
removal the depreciated Mysql4 model in favor of the new Resource
model.
