this is a repository of the code for my progress with
the book Magento PHP Developers Guide by Allan MacGregor.
Other resources can be found on the authors github:

https://github.com/amacgregor/mdg_giftreg

This repo reflects code being created to work with Magento
Enterprise version 1.13.1.0

Some differences from Mr. MacGregor's code are meant to avoid
collision with the Enterprise GiftRegistry module, in particular
the frontend route. Othere relate to issues found with the module.
for instance, in ...template/mdg/edit.phtml, the author relies on 
the current loaded registry being in the session, however, if the
registry has not yet been viewed by the current user, it will not
be available.
